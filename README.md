Replication code for all the figures and simulation results displayed in the manuscript *"A new flexible Bayesian hypothesis test for multivariate data"* (Guti√©rrez et al. 2022). The figures and datasets are saved `figures/` and `data/`, respectively. Each figure/dataset is accompanied by a homonym R/julia script in the same folder. For obvious reasons, you should replicate the datasets before the figures. Please, use the attached Dockerfile (in dev stage) for replication (otherwise, it will be difficult to fix eventual bugs).
