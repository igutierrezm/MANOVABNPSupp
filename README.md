Replication code for the figures and web figures displayed in the manuscript *"A new flexible Bayesian hypothesis test for multivariate data"*. The figures and datasets are saved `images/` and `data/`, respectively. Each figure/dataset is accompanied by n homonym R/julia script in the same folder. For obvious reasons, you should replicate the datasets before the figures. Please, use the attached Dockerfile (in dev stage) for replication (otherwise, it will be difficult to fix eventual bugs).
